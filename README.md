A work in progress application for planning meals to generate shopping lists.

## Getting Started

Required assets must be installed via [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
bower install
```

Then all gems must be installed via [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```sh
bundle install
```

A few environment variables must also be set:

```sh
export SECRET_KEY_BASE='random string of characters'
```

The application can then be [deployed](http://rubyonrails.org/deploy/) like any Rails application.
